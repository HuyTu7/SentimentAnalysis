#Supervised Learning Techniques for Sentiment Analytics

In this project, sentiment analysis will be performed over IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data. Our goal will be to classify tweets or movie reviews as either positive or negative. Towards this
end, labeled training will be given to build the model and labeled testing data to evaluate the model. For classification, logistic regression as well as a Naive Bayes
classifier will be applied from pythonâ€™s well regarded machine learning package 'scikitlearn'.
